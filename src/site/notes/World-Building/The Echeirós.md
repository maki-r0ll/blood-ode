The world has always been a place of wonder—filled with beings of immense power, landscapes that defy logic, and forces beyond mortal comprehension. But beyond all of that, beyond even the oldest gods and the most ancient of cosmic laws, exist the **Echeirós**—the unseen architects, the hands of the universe, the silent weavers of fate.

They are not gods, nor do they demand worship. They do not speak, nor do they need to. Their existence is written in the stars, in the shifting tides of destiny, in the echoes of forgotten time. They are **all-powerful, all-knowing, all-encompassing.** To most, they are nothing more than myth—whispers passed down by oracles and scholars who dare to look too deep into the fabric of reality. But to those who have felt their influence, the Echeirós are undeniable.

**Nithlah** –  The Giver and Taker of Fate

A time lord more omnipotent than any other being to exist. So far it can see into the future that with a snap of its fingers, it can change the timeline of the whole universe if it so chooses. Nithlah gives the power of seeing to the gods and many other mortals, lonely in their own universe, wanting to share their own insight with those who are privy to it. One of the only Echeirós to enjoy watching the lives of mortals.

**Urkhalos** – The First and Last

Urkhalos is not merely a god but the very fabric of existence. It is said that before time began, there was only Urkhalos—a vast, dreaming consciousness that gave birth to the universe through its thoughts. As its dreams solidified into reality, the cosmos took shape, stars ignited, and the great cycle of life began. But all things must return to Urkhalos in the end, dissolving into the same primordial void from which they emerged.

**Threxion** – The Unseen Judge

Threxion is the silent, impartial arbiter of all existence, the unseen force that weighs every soul, every action, and every fate on the cosmic scales. Unlike gods of vengeance or mercy, Threxion does not punish or reward—only judges. It is neither cruel nor kind, only inevitable.

**Vaelthar** – The Cosmic Balance

Vaelthar is not a god of morality or judgment but of pure cosmic equilibrium. Every action, every force, and every choice in the universe creates an imbalance—Vaelthar exists to correct it. When one power grows too great, Vaelthar ensures its fall. When destruction looms too near, Vaelthar restores what was lost.
