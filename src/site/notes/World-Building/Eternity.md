The **Afterlife of Etharis**, known as **Eternity**, is a realm where all souls, regardless of their actions in life, are ultimately bound after death. However, it is not a singular, homogeneous space. Instead, Eternity is divided into **tiers**, each representing different states of existence, shaped by the soul's nature and the choices they made during their lifetime. These tiers are not places to roam, but rather **realms** where the soul resides in a kind of **existential stasis**, stripped of physical form, yet experiencing eternal states of peace or torment, depending on their deeds and the lessons they learned in life.

### **The Structure of Eternity**

Eternity is not a physical landscape, but a metaphysical plane—a place where time and space are fluid, and one's perception of reality is shaped by the soul's spiritual state. It is divided into several **tiers**, each representing a distinct level of spiritual fulfillment or **unfulfillment**. Souls cannot physically move through these tiers without effort, and the transition is a slow, often painful, journey of **self-reflection** and **redemption**.

The **tiers** of Eternity are often depicted as a **vast celestial staircase** stretching upward into infinity, each step leading either to greater tranquility or deeper despair.

#### **The Lower Tiers – Strife and Suffering**

The lower tiers of Eternity are the harshest. Souls who are bound here are tormented by their own actions, their guilt, hatred, and selfishness anchoring them to these levels. These souls may have lived lives filled with evil, malice, and hatred, and thus they remain trapped in a state of **eternal unrest**, haunted by the consequences of their actions.

- **The First Tier (The Pit of Wrath)**: The lowest of the lower tiers, the Pit is a place of constant **strife**, **violence**, and **suffering**. Souls who reside here are endlessly tortured by their own regret and sorrow, perpetually reliving their worst sins. They are bound in an endless loop of despair and aggression, unable to find release. It is the place where those who have committed **atrocities** or **deep betrayal** are sent, and they are tormented by the consequences of their choices, forced to confront their actions in an unending cycle.

- **The Second Tier (The Wastes of Regret)**: Slightly higher but no less unpleasant, this tier is filled with **desolation** and **loneliness**. Souls who are trapped here are burdened by their regrets, haunted by choices that caused harm but were not malicious. These souls are often weighed down by unresolved guilt, and their torment is marked by the **endless yearning** to correct past mistakes, but they are unable to change their actions. The Wastes reflect the **emptiness** that comes from a life lived without meaningful redemption or understanding.

- **The Third Tier (The Vale of Lost Hope)**: This tier is a desolate, **gray landscape**, where the souls are overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness. These are the souls who lived with selfishness, greed, or apathy, but did not actively pursue evil. Instead, they simply **wasted their potential** or **turned away from those in need**. Here, the souls long for the peace they were never able to grasp in life, but are locked in a state of **inertia**, unable to move forward, stuck in an endless yearning for something they cannot attain.
#### **The Middle Tiers – Reflection and Awareness**

The middle tiers of Eternity are where souls begin the process of **self-reflection**, and where some may begin to heal. These souls are those who may not have lived perfect lives, but who sought to better themselves, to learn from their mistakes, and to change. Here, the souls reflect on the lives they led, the wrongs they committed, and the lessons they learned.

- **The Fourth Tier (The Mirror of Contemplation)**: This tier is a place of **solitude** and **meditation**, where souls are shown the mirror of their lives. They are forced to confront every aspect of their existence—their flaws, their failures, and their virtues. The soul is presented with opportunities to **contemplate** the impact they had on the world, to understand where they went astray, and to begin the slow process of **forgiveness**—both for themselves and for others. This is a **crucial moment** in the journey of the soul, where they are given a chance to redeem themselves, but the process is long and difficult.

- **The Fifth Tier (The Field of Renewal)**: Souls who reach this tier have gained a level of **understanding** and **self-awareness**. This tier represents a place of **growth** and **regeneration**, where the soul is allowed to heal from the harm they inflicted upon themselves and others. Souls here are able to experience **peace**, and some even begin to manifest **positive traits**, like kindness, compassion, and humility. This is a place where souls work toward **spiritual wholeness** and **inner peace**, understanding that they must work for their **spiritual evolution**.

#### **The Upper Tiers – Serenity and Peace**

The upper tiers of Eternity are the domains of the most virtuous souls—those who lived with selflessness, compassion, and wisdom. These are the places of **eternal serenity**, where souls find rest after their long journeys. The higher a soul ascends in the tiers, the greater the peace they experience, as they are reunited with the divine forces of the cosmos in a state of bliss.

- **The Sixth Tier (The Radiance of Understanding)**: This tier is bathed in a gentle, golden light, a place of **complete serenity** and **peaceful contemplation**. Souls who reside here have achieved a level of spiritual harmony where they are fully aware of their place in the greater tapestry of existence. Their time in this tier is marked by a profound **understanding** of the world and the interconnectedness of all life. The soul is free of suffering, enjoying a **blissful existence** without conflict or uncertainty.

- **The Seventh Tier (The Eternal Garden)**: The highest and most peaceful tier, the Eternal Garden is a place where the souls are bathed in an **everlasting peace**, surrounded by landscapes of infinite beauty and tranquility. These souls have not only **found redemption** but have achieved a state of **perfect spiritual harmony**, their essence fully integrated with the cosmic forces of the universe. The **peace** here is undisturbed by time, and the souls experience eternal rest, free from strife, regret, or suffering. It is the ultimate reward for those who lived with **unwavering virtue** and **compassion**.
### **Movement Through the Tiers**

It is possible, though incredibly difficult, for souls to **ascend** through the tiers of Eternity. Movement between these realms is based on a soul's **growth** and **self-reflection**. Those in the lower tiers may rise by **understanding the consequences** of their actions, making efforts toward **redemption**, or **helping others** in their own journey. However, the climb is treacherous, and many souls become trapped in their own despair or self-righteousness, never able to break free from the cycle of suffering.

On the other hand, even souls in the highest realms can **descend** if they become complacent or if they cease their efforts toward **self-reflection** and **growth**. The power of **self-awareness** and **continued self-improvement** is paramount in this afterlife, and those who become stagnant may find themselves slipping into lower realms.
