The **Spirits of Etharis** are not gods, nor are they the Primordials. They are the lost souls that wander the land, ancient and powerful beings that once lived and walked among the mortals of Etharis. They are the souls of **fallen heroes**, **ancient ancestors**, and **forgotten beings**, all with their own vast reservoirs of wisdom, power, and experience. These spirits do not seek worship, nor do they demand sacrifice. Instead, they roam the world, quietly observing, guiding, and occasionally **touching** those whom they deem worthy. Their connection to the living world is subtle, yet profoundly transformative.

### **The Spirit-Touched**

To be **spirit-touched** is to receive the **blessing** of these lost souls. Those chosen by the spirits are bestowed with a gift—a divine mark that opens them to the **combined power** of all the spirits who roam the land of Etharis. The touch of the spirits does not grant immortality or divine godlike status, but it gives the individual an immense well of **spiritual energy** and **insight** into the mysteries of the world.

A **spirit-touched** individual becomes a vessel through which the **wisdom** and **strength** of countless souls flow. They may exhibit extraordinary abilities, from heightened senses to powerful **magical prowess**, but the spirits' influence is not without its cost. The spirit-touched may hear whispers from the dead, see visions of the past, or even feel the presence of long-lost souls at the edge of their consciousness. Some of them even gain the ability to communicate with the spirits directly, either for guidance, power, or understanding. However, this connection is not always peaceful—sometimes, the spirits demand that their chosen ones undertake **tasks** or **quests** that align with the spirits' goals or desires, or risk falling out of favor.

### **How One Becomes Spirit-Touched**

Becoming **spirit-touched** is not a matter of fate—it is a matter of **worthiness**. The spirits of Etharis are incredibly discerning and will only reach out to those who have earned their favor. They are drawn to individuals who are in moments of **great despair**, **heartfelt resolve**, or **incredibly selfless acts**. These souls are typically those who possess something that resonates deeply with the spirits—a **burning ambition**, an **unshakable sense of justice**, or a **deep respect for life** and its mysteries.

In some cases, the spirits may be drawn to those who are on the **verge of death**, granting them a moment of reprieve, in the hope that the individual will rise to **greater purpose**. Other times, a powerful **moment of sacrifice** or an act of **great courage** in battle or during a crisis may attract the attention of the spirits. Sometimes, an individual simply finds themselves in the **right place at the right time**, stumbling into an ancient **place of power**, where a forgotten spirit resides and chooses to make contact.
