### **The People of the Castinellan Province** – Before the Celestial Codex

Before the **Revelation of the Shattered Gods** and the creation of the **Celestial Codex**, the people of the **Castinellan Province** lived in a time of deep discord and religious strife. The gods were divided—each ruling over their own realms and domains with little regard for one another. Faith was a personal and often tumultuous journey, with mortal beings bound to gods who demanded absolute loyalty, but gave little understanding of the greater cosmic order. The province itself was a battleground for divine supremacy, with the people caught in the crossfire of competing deities.

#### **The Dragonborn of Old**

Before the creation of the **Celestial Codex**, the **Dragonborn** were the most powerful and influential people in the Castinellan Province, but their power was fragmented. The Dragonborn followed several different divine patrons—gods of war, knowledge, and protection—each sect of Dragonborn serving one god above all others.

- **Religion & Culture**: The Dragonborn were religious zealots, with each faction fervently believing their god was the one true deity. The Dragonborn cities and monasteries were often divided along religious lines, with rival temples existing side by side, each claiming to have the true knowledge of the divine.
- **Divine Conflicts**: The Dragonborn often found themselves at odds with each other, clashing over which god was the most worthy of worship. Holy wars between rival Dragonborn factions were common, and it was not unheard of for their gods to directly intervene, leading to divine manifestations and violent disputes. These conflicts weakened the Dragonborn and prevented them from achieving any lasting unity.
- **Role in Society**: The Dragonborn ruled over the scholarly and military orders, with each city having its own temple-guardians. These Dragonborn warrior-priests were dedicated to maintaining the power of their gods and enforcing their will on the people. However, there was little cooperation between these warrior-priests, and their influence over the populace was often contested by rival religious orders.
#### **The Humans and Their Faiths**

The humans of Castinella were a diverse and fractured people, living in small kingdoms, city-states, and rural villages, each worshipping their own gods or pantheons. Faith was often seen as a tool for personal gain, with many humans practicing a form of spiritual barter—offering devotion to the gods in exchange for blessings, power, or wealth.

- **Religion & Culture**: Humans were deeply religious, but their practices often lacked the structure and discipline of the Dragonborn. Some humans followed deities of agriculture, fertility, or protection, while others were drawn to gods of war or chaos, each faith offering different promises of protection or favor.
- **Division & Conflict**: There were frequent holy conflicts between human sects, particularly in the provinces where one god’s teachings would often clash with another’s. While some humans sought enlightenment through meditation and devotion, many others used their faith as a means of power—raising armies in the name of their gods or waging wars to prove their divine favor.
- **Role in Society**: The human population was largely governed by kings and lords who adhered to a specific religious faction. These rulers used religion as a way to justify their authority, claiming divine right or intervention from the gods to maintain control over their people. The common folk would turn to their priests, who were often just as much concerned with worldly power as they were with spiritual guidance.
#### **The Halflings and Their Quiet Faith**

The **Halflings** of Castinella were a peaceful, humble people, largely disconnected from the larger conflicts that plagued the land. Their faith was simple but sincere—focused on the protection of family, community, and the divine forces that provided for their well-being.

- **Religion & Culture**: Halfling faith was centered around gods of hearth, harvest, and protection. They viewed the divine as forces that ensured their prosperity and happiness, and their faith was built on the rituals of daily life—offering prayers for a good harvest, protection from illness, and safe journeys.
- **Division & Conflict**: The Halflings were largely untouched by the religious wars that plagued the other races. Their faith was not one of grand temples or massive ceremonies, but rather an intimate and personal connection with the divine. They did not seek to spread their faith or convert others, and they kept to themselves, avoiding the larger conflicts of the time.
- **Role in Society**: Halflings were known for their role as diplomats and peacekeepers, quietly working behind the scenes to broker compromises and ensure the survival of their people amidst the larger struggles between the more powerful races.

***Elves and Dwarves for the most part did not live in this province.***
