The **Great Burach Empire** is a vast and powerful human kingdom, founded upon a legacy of expansion, military might, and a vision of **unified peace**. The current ruler, **King Otto Whitlock**, is revered as one of the greatest monarchs in the history of Etharis. His reign is marked by a **compassionate vision** for the world, where the provinces of Etharis exist in **harmony**, with all races and peoples living side by side without the fear of conflict. However, Otto’s utopian dream is not without its challenges, and the tension between his **pacifist ambitions** and the **actions of his governors** threatens the very foundation of his empire.

### **King Otto Whitlock – The Philosopher King**

King **Otto Whitlock** is a towering figure, both physically and ideologically. Widely regarded as **the greatest ruler of Etharis**, he ascended to the throne at a time when the Burach Empire was fractured, with warring factions within and a chaotic, divided world. Otto’s rule represents a **break from tradition**, as he is deeply committed to an ideology that places **compassion, diplomacy**, and **understanding** above the sword and shield.

Otto’s vision is that the only true path to lasting peace is **mutual respect and understanding** between all the different peoples of Etharis. He believes that only through cooperation, dialogue, and compromise can the various provinces live in **harmony** and create a unified world. For this reason, he has spent much of his reign **forging alliances** with various factions—whether human, elf, dwarf, or even other races that traditionally view one another with suspicion.

His dedication to peace is legendary, with stories of his **merciful victories** and **attempts at diplomacy** echoing through the halls of history. Otto has been known to enter battlefields, not as a warrior, but as a **peacemaker**, offering those who oppose him a chance to lay down their arms and live in harmony with the Burach Empire. In many cases, his actions have led to **ceasefires** and **treaties** that have spared thousands of lives. This has earned him titles such as “**The Peacemaker of Etharis**” and “**The Compassionate King**.”

However, Otto's methods are not without their detractors. While his rule is largely seen as **progressive**, there are many within the empire, particularly in the **military and among the nobility**, who view his pacifist approach as **weak** and **naive**. Otto’s refusal to wage war without exhaustive diplomatic efforts has caused **resentment** among those who believe that only through strength can the empire grow and maintain dominance in Etharis.
### **The Great Divisions Within the Burach Empire**

While Otto Whitlock envisions a peaceful and unified Etharis, the reality of the **Burach Empire's political landscape** is far more complicated. Though Otto stands as the ruler, his empire is made up of **regional governors** and **military leaders**, each with their own interests, priorities, and ambitions. These leaders, while they may publicly align with Otto’s vision, often operate behind his back to further their own agendas.

#### **The Governors and Military Commanders**

Some of the most prominent governors and commanders of the Burach Empire are **ambitious**, **power-hungry**, and believe that Otto’s vision of peace is **too idealistic**. They argue that the only way to bring true **order and security** to the lands of Etharis is through **military force**, and they often take matters into their own hands, ignoring the peaceful directives of King Otto. These military leaders are willing to **strike against neighboring kingdoms** and provinces—most notably the **Charnault Kingdom**—in order to **expand the empire's influence** and maintain their own political power.

For example:

- **General Marius Ravenger**, a powerful military commander in the empire, is a well-known critic of Otto’s pacifism. Ravenger believes that the Burach Empire is too **vulnerable** to external threats, and he views the Charnault Kingdom’s **mystical power** as an immediate threat to the empire’s future. He has been pushing for a military campaign to **seize** Charnault’s lands and resources, especially those related to the **Primordials’ power**. Though Otto has repeatedly dismissed Ravenger’s proposals, the general has secretly gathered a **coalition of powerful nobles** and **warriors** to carry out his plans without the king’s approval.

- **Governor Tyra Vaelun**, stationed in the **western borderlands**, has long argued that the empire must act decisively to **control trade routes** and ensure **military superiority** over neighboring territories. She often **makes covert deals with mercenary groups**, providing them with resources and backing to **attack** and **raid** key locations, even though Otto would prefer diplomatic solutions. Vaelun’s influence has created significant tension, particularly with the **elven territories** of **Charnault**, who view her tactics as a direct violation of Otto’s promises.


#### **The Imperial Court and the Factions**

Inside the imperial court, factions are constantly at odds over Otto’s vision. The **philosophers, diplomats**, and **advisors** who surround the king are strong supporters of his peaceful ideology, but they are often outnumbered by those who are willing to compromise the kingdom’s moral integrity in the name of **expansionism**.

- **Duchess Elina Ghirald**, one of Otto’s closest advisors, is a member of the court who supports Otto’s vision but has grown frustrated with the empire’s growing military influence. She tries to maintain a sense of **balance** by advising Otto on diplomatic matters but has become increasingly skeptical that the king can maintain his idealism in the face of growing military opposition.

- **Chancellor Orlin Darnel**, another of Otto’s trusted ministers, advocates for a **middle ground**, where the empire maintains its current borders but still builds its strength through alliances and economic power, rather than through military conquest. He is fiercely loyal to the king but is deeply concerned about the threats to peace posed by rogue military factions.

### **The Tension with Charnault**

One of the most prominent points of tension within the **Burach Empire** is its relationship with **Charnault**, the **elven kingdom** known for its deep spiritual connection with the **Primordials** and its untapped natural wealth. While Otto sees the land as an important ally that can help the empire remain **sustainable** and **flourishing**, many of his generals and governors view the **Charnault Kingdom** as a threat that must be neutralized.

The **Burach Empire’s military** regularly makes **covert incursions** into Charnault territory, trying to undermine the **elves’ power** without Otto’s approval. The situation is further complicated by the presence of **elven druids**, **nature spirits**, and **Primordials** in Charnault, who **actively oppose** the Burach Empire’s imperialism. Though Otto has repeatedly tried to open diplomatic channels with Charnault, his efforts are often thwarted by his own military commanders, who are more inclined to **forcefully annex** the **primordial-rich land**.

### **The Plague’s Arrival**

The plague, known as the **Blight of Ashen Tears**, began as a small, localized outbreak in the **eastern provinces** of Etharis. At first, it seemed like any other illness—fevers, rashes, and disorientation—but it quickly grew much worse. The symptoms progressed rapidly, with **severe internal bleeding**, **insatiable thirst**, and a **slow loss of consciousness** before death. What set this plague apart from others was its unnerving **ability to spread**, often carried by the very **wind**, **water**, or **food** that people depended on. It was as if the **very land itself** had become tainted.

While many regions were affected, the **Burach Empire** was hit hardest. The plague struck with particular ferocity in **Burach's capital**, **Altenheim**, where Otto Whitlock ruled. Entire sections of the city were devastated, with both the **noble elite** and **commoners** alike succumbing to the mysterious illness. The royal court, once a bustling hub of diplomacy, intellectualism, and culture, became a shell of its former self, decimated by the plague’s relentless march.

### **King Otto’s Disappearance**

In the midst of this turmoil, **King Otto Whitlock**, the **benevolent ruler** who had long been admired for his compassion, **vanished**. No one witnessed his departure, and no one knows for certain what happened to him. Some believe he was **struck down** by the plague, his body claimed by the same disease that had ravaged his people. Others claim that Otto, in his last act of **self-sacrifice**, withdrew into the depths of the royal palace to **take the plague** upon himself, willing to endure the suffering in place of his people.

But a growing faction of dissenters, both inside and outside of the empire, began to whisper more **sinister theories**. Some began to wonder if **Otto was not a victim of the plague**, but perhaps its **creator**.

### **The Aftermath: The Disappearance Becomes Legend**

Otto’s **sudden disappearance** marked the **beginning of a deep divide** within the Burach Empire. To many, he was the heart of the kingdom, and without him, the **empire began to splinter**. Some believed that **Otto Whitlock** had **betrayed** them, that his **dream of peace had failed**, and that he had willingly unleashed the plague upon his kingdom as a final, terrible act of **atonement** for his **failed ideals**. Others refused to accept the possibility that Otto was anything but the kind, **benevolent monarch** they had always known, believing that the **plague itself** was a natural disaster beyond anyone's control.

The **rumors** about Otto’s involvement in the plague grew into **legend**, and some factions even began to see Otto as a **fallen god**, one who had tried to save his kingdom but ultimately became the **instrument of its downfall**. These factions now seek his **return**, either in the form of a **redeemed king** who can restore peace, or as an **undead** ruler who might rise again to claim the world in the name of his **twisted vision**.

Meanwhile, there are others who believe that Otto is **alive**, though changed. Some say he **wandered off into the wilds**, consumed by the plague’s cursed magic, and now **wanders as a spectral presence**, seeking redemption for his sins. These followers whisper that Otto will return to lead them once again when the world is on the brink of **collapse**—perhaps as the **savior of Etharis**, or as something **far worse**.
