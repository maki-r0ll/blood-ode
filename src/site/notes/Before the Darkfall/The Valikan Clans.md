### **A Land of Endless Night**

The Valikan Clans are defined by the **endless darkness** that blankets their lands for most of the year. This prolonged night is a result of the province’s **northern latitude**, where the sun barely rises above the horizon during the winter months, and the **moon**—if it appears at all—casts a cold, pale light over the frozen landscape. During these long, dark months, many of the clan’s inhabitants retreat into their subterranean dwellings, **caves**, and **fortresses** carved into the mountainsides, where they seek shelter from the **eternal cold** and **hungry beasts** that roam the land.

This unyielding darkness gives rise to the belief among the scholars of **Castinellan** that **no gods** claim the Valikan Clans as their dominion. Unlike the **divine protection** seen in the **Charnault Kingdom** or the **faithful kingdoms** of the south, the Valikan people live without the comfort of celestial guidance. This lack of divine influence leaves the land exposed to **fiends**, **nightmarish creatures**, and other **supernatural horrors** that prowl in the gloom.

### **The Orcs of the Valikan Clans**

The orcs who reside in the Valikan Clans are a proud and resilient people, hardened by the harshness of their environment. They are **fierce warriors**, driven by a deep sense of survival and a **warrior’s code** passed down through generations. For the Valikan orcs, the world is one of **constant battle**, whether against the elements, fiends, or their **neighboring enemies**.

The orcs in the Valikan Clans live in a complex system of **tribal clans**, each led by a powerful **chieftain** or **warchief**. These clans are bound together by bloodlines, oaths, and the shared goal of **survival** in a land where **weakness** is often a death sentence. Their villages and settlements are often **fortresses**, built into the mountainsides and deep underground, to protect themselves from the endless night and the **creatures of the dark** that stalk the surface.

Despite their **ferocity**, the orcs of the Valikan Clans are not mindless savages. They possess a deep **connection to the land** and the primal forces that rule it, including the **spirits** of the **mountains** and **forests**. They are skilled hunters and warriors, using the natural resources of the land to forge weapons, armor, and tools that are as much a part of their cultural identity as their battle prowess.

However, this sense of **unity** and **strength** is often tested by external pressures. The Valikan orcs are **divided** between clans, and this **tribal conflict** is compounded by the presence of the **Dragon-kin** in the region.

### **The Dragon-Kin and the Stolen Gold**
[[World-Building/Dragon-kin\|Dragon-kin]]
In the eastern reaches of the Valikan Clans, the **Dragon-kin**—a fierce and ancient race of **dragons** —hold sway over great **mountains of gold**. The Dragon-kin are powerful and have long held control over vast caches of treasure, much of which was **plundered** from the orcs who once controlled these lands.

This **theft of treasure** has created an **eternal conflict** between the orcs of the Valikan Clans and the Dragon-kin, a battle over resources, **territory**, and **pride**. The Dragon-kin, being mighty and arrogant, have often seen the orcs as little more than **barbarians**, and they show little regard for the orcish traditions or sense of honor. The orcs, on the other hand, see the Dragon-kin as **thieves**, who stole the wealth that was rightfully theirs by **blood and right**.

The clash between the **orcs** and the **Dragon-kin** is brutal and ongoing. The orcs have mounted numerous **raids** and **assaults** on the Dragon-kin’s hoards, hoping to reclaim what they believe is rightfully theirs, but the Dragon-kin are no less formidable. Many a battle has been fought between these two great forces, each one leaving scars on the land, the people, and their souls.

However, the stakes of this conflict are far higher than **just treasure**. The orcs of the Valikan Clans believe that the **gold** hoarded by the Dragon-kin holds **power**—not just wealth, but also ancient **magic** that has been passed down from time immemorial. To the Dragon-kin, the gold is not merely currency but a **symbol of their dominance** and their **control** over the region. This constant struggle has **stretched the orcish resources** thin, and many fear that without the ability to reclaim their treasure, the **Valikan Clans** will be overwhelmed.
### **The Caste System of the Orcs**

The Orcs have a rigid **caste system** that governs every aspect of their society. This system is deeply tied to their **tribal structure**, which revolves around their belief in the **ancestral spirits** and the importance of each member's role within the clan. Unlike the often simplistic and crude depictions of Orcs in other cultures, the Orcs see themselves as a society of **natural order** and **balance**, each caste serving a distinct and essential function.

1. **The Warborn** (Warriors and Leaders)

- The **Warborn** caste is the highest and most revered within Orc society. These Orcs are the **greatest warriors**, chosen not only for their **physical prowess** but for their ability to **lead** and inspire others.

The Warborn are often chosen by the **ancestral spirits**, who guide them in their decisions and provide them with the blessing of strength and victory.
- They are the **generals**, the **warchiefs**, and the **champions** of the clans. They wear **ornate armor**, decorated with **symbolic marks** representing their victories, and their **battle standards** are passed down through generations, becoming sacred relics.

2. **The Stonehearts** (Craftsmen and Builders)

- The **Stonehearts** are the **craftsmen**, **artisans**, and **builders** of Orc society. While they may not be as **physically imposing** as the Warborn, the Stonehearts are highly valued for their **skills** in creating **weapons**, **tools**, and **fortifications**. Their craftsmanship is known to be of the highest quality, and they are the ones who forge the mighty **weapons** used by the Warborn.
- The **Stonehearts** are also responsible for the construction of **dwellings**, **temples**, and **battlements**, creating structures that are not only functional but also **symbolically rich**. Many of their buildings are designed to honor the **ancestral spirits** and the **elements**, blending practicality with sacred design.
- Stoneheart Orcs are highly respected in the clan for their **innovation**, and their work is often seen as a reflection of their **spiritual connection** to the land and the ancient gods.
3. **The Bloodsingers** (Shamans and Healers)

- The **Bloodsingers** hold a sacred place in Orc society as the **spiritual leaders**, **shamans**, and **healers**. They are the intermediaries between the living and the **ancestral spirits**, and their role is crucial in maintaining the **balance** of the Orc clans. The Bloodsingers are tasked with performing **rituals**, interpreting **omens**, and **healing** the wounded and sick.
- Bloodsingers wield great power, both in their **connection to the spirits** and in their **knowledge of ancient rituals**. They are the keepers of the clan’s history and wisdom, and their words carry great weight in matters of life and death. Many Bloodsingers are trained in the use of **herbal remedies**, **sacred chants**, and **mystical rites** that are passed down through generations.
- While they are not warriors, Bloodsingers are highly respected, and their presence on the battlefield can turn the tide of war. They wield their **magical powers** to heal the wounded and bolster the strength of their kin, often calling upon the spirits of the ancestors to aid them in times of need.
4. **The Bonebreakers** (Laborers and Hunters)

- The **Bonebreakers** are the **laborers** and **hunters** of Orc society. They perform the day-to-day tasks necessary to sustain the clan, from hunting game to gathering resources and working the land. While they may not hold the same prestige as the Warborn or the Bloodsingers, they are the backbone of Orc society, ensuring that the clan thrives.
- Bonebreakers are known for their **toughness** and **endurance**, and they are often chosen for their ability to endure hardship and survive in the harshest conditions. They are skilled hunters, using **primitive** weapons and tactics to track and kill dangerous beasts for food, while also gathering the materials necessary for the Stonehearts to craft their weapons and tools.
- The Bonebreakers are also the **scouts** of the clan, often sent out ahead of the main force to gather information about the enemy or locate valuable resources. Though they are not given the same glory as the Warborn, the Bonebreakers are vital to the clan’s success.
5. **The Warbrides** (Mothers and Nurturers)

- The **Warbrides** are the **mothers** and **nurturers** of Orc society. Though they are often not seen on the battlefield, their role is just as important. They are the caregivers who ensure the clan’s survival by raising the next generation of warriors, crafting the **strongest warriors** from birth.
- The Warbrides are also highly skilled in **tactics** and **strategy**, as they are often the ones who raise young warriors and teach them the **ways of combat** and **honor**. They also play a vital role in the healing and caring for the injured and sick, and their homes are often places of **rejuvenation** and **restoration** for Orcs who return from battle.

### **The Brutality of Orc Battle**

While the Orcs are a sophisticated society, their means of battle are often brutal and overwhelming. **Strength** is the most valued trait in the Orc clans, and battle is seen as a way to prove one’s worth and honor. **Axes**, **swords**, and **maces** are favored weapons, but Orc warriors also use **large war machines**, **siege weapons**, and **beasts of burden** in their campaigns. They fight with a savagery that is unmatched, yet their brutality is tempered by a strict **war code** that demands honor, loyalty, and respect.

Their battle tactics rely heavily on the **psychological impact** of overwhelming force, using **shock and awe** to break their enemies’ spirits. Orcs are also trained in **large-scale battles**, where their **strategy** is just as important as their raw power. While they are brutal in battle, they are not mindless killers—they use tactics, teamwork, and discipline to achieve victory.

### **The Brutal Beauty of Orc Culture**

While many outsiders see the Orcs as little more than barbaric beasts, their society is far from primitive. Their **caste system** brings order, their **rituals** bring meaning, and their **values** bring purpose to their existence. In the eyes of the Orcs, their ways are honorable, and their brutality is simply a reflection of the harsh world they live in—a world where strength, unity, and respect for tradition are the keys to survival.

In truth, the Orcs are a people who embody the balance between the **primitive** and the **sophisticated**, a race whose culture is deeply tied to both the **fury of battle** and the **wisdom of the ancients**. The Orc clans are not just savages; they are a proud, ancient people whose society, while brutal, is driven by a deep **sense of purpose** and **honor**.
