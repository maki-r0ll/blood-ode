# The Burach Empire

Capital: Altenheim  
Ruler: King Casmir Thalor  
Core Values: Strength and Pride

Once a beacon of cultural convergence, the Burach Empire has since rotted from within. Strength now supersedes wisdom, pride drowns compassion, and conquest replaces unity. The streets of Altenheim echo with both opulence and despair—its high towers gilded with wealth, while the gutters run thick with the grime of the forsaken. The empire no longer celebrates culture—it consumes it.

### Economy

The economy of the Burach Empire is a twisted mirror of its former self. Once sustained by trade, artisanship, and scholarly pursuits, it is now wholly consumed by the demands of war. Coin is no longer a tool of commerce but a weapon, endlessly minted and destroyed to fuel the imperial machine. Copper has become more plentiful than bread, silver buys little more than silence, and gold is hoarded in vaults where it gathers dust under armed guard.

While a rigid caste system does not exist on paper, the social structure is divided sharply into three realms: the Dravari (the destitute), the Haldrim (the decadent elite), and the Kavariin (the devout military). Many Dravari are born into illiteracy, receiving no formal education. Instead, they are sent to military camps as early as age seven to begin their mandatory ten years of service—training in discipline, obedience, and the doctrine of flame. For them, survival is earned through submission. The Haldrim, by contrast, often evade this service altogether. Their wealth grants them tutors, archives, and influence, allowing them to be funneled into intelligence divisions, administrative posts, or, more often, to remain in their gilded estates, untouched by the burdens of war. Even among the Kavariin, literacy and purpose are luxuries measured by lineage and coin. The army is the surest ladder out of poverty, though it is one built of broken bodies and burned futures.

The Ebon Syndicate thrives in the void left by collapsing trade guilds, operating vast shadow markets across the empire. They deal in essentials—grain, dried meats, rare spices—and for the wealthy and reckless, forbidden tomes and volatile magical contraband. Their presence is tolerated, even useful, by those who benefit from their silent efficiency. Official trade is limited to a single major artery leading into the Grey Spine Mountains, where dwarves continue to supply mithril, silver, and iron under ancient accords. These materials are vital to sustaining Burach’s military dominance, even as the mines deepen and the alliances fray.

### Government

Burach’s laws are less a system of justice and more a doctrine of fear. Magic is the true crime here, or rather, its independence. Known as Valekari, magic-users are considered dangerous unless sanctioned by the throne. This stems from the cataclysm of Year 50, when untempered blood moons ignited magical potential across Etharis. Whole cities fell in fire and ruin. In response, the Empire began testing all newborns for magical aptitude. If potential is found, the child is seized by royal agents—often Valekari themselves—and inducted into a lifetime of controlled service.

King Thalric’s founding of the Cincture Light codified this fear into fanaticism. The Inquisition became the state’s spiritual arm, and his own sons were made its first Gloom Knights. These elite soldiers are not just warriors—they are the Empire’s divine blades. Shrouded in mystery and clad in ash-black armor, many claim they are touched by the divine, their eyes glowing faintly beneath visors, halos of golden light appearing during executions.

Under Casmir Thalor, this institution has grown ever more ruthless. Public burnings are now rituals—calculated displays of absolute power. The phrase “To ash. To dust.” echoes across city squares, reminding all who hear that redemption is only granted through flame. While low-ranking Inquisitors have been known to bend to bribes or sympathy, the Gloom Knights do not yield. It is said their very blood has been transmuted by Immariel’s blessing.

Amid this brutal order, the Ebon Syndicate remains ever-present. Their control of goods and secrets gives them a power that rivals small kingdoms. They are not resistance—they are adaptation incarnate. In their own words: “What the crown forgets, we remember.”

#### Foreign Relations

The Burach Empire is feared, not respected. Its borders are steel walls, not bridges. Few nations maintain even a veneer of diplomacy. The divine backing of Immariel—Architect Eternal—deters would-be invaders. Her presence is more than myth; her doctrine of absolute order is etched into Burach’s every law, carved into their temples, and whispered through their courts.

Their greatest and most enduring enemy is the Ostoyan Empire, ruled by the immortal Renwick Thorne—a vampire king and Valekari. The Burach Empire views him as the antithesis of all it stands for: a creature of chaos, forbidden magic, and unnatural life. Their war is unending, not out of strategy, but out of sacred conviction. No peace has ever been brokered, no parley considered. Their conflict is as old as memory and twice as bitter.

Burach has expanded into parts of the Castinellan Province and Charnault Kingdom. These annexed peoples—dragonborn, elves, and others—are given no quarter, only conscription. Many enlist willingly to escape destitution, others out of fear. Behind closed doors, resistance simmers, but within the Empire, rebellion is death. Espionage is rampant on all sides. Agents walk unseen between courts, temples, and barracks. Allegiances shift like sand, but always the weight of Burach’s boot holds the ground.

#### Politics

King Casmir Thalor’s reign began in blood and vision. As a Gloom Knight, he was already a hero among zealots, his name etched in the records of a hundred inquisitions. When Immariel appeared to him in divine revelation, she did not offer guidance—she gave command. The old king was executed in his sleep, and Casmir ascended with a new doctrine: absolute order through divine judgment.

His rule is uncontested. The High Council exists, but its members are nameless, their identities hidden even from one another. It is said they wear masks of burnished iron and speak only in whispers during nightlit assemblies. To speak against the King is to invite annihilation—not by law, but by faith. It is believed that Immariel hears every traitorous thought and delivers it to Casmir in dreams.

He has no queen. His daughter just as hidden as his council. Some whisper that his blood is too divine for mortal legacy, others that he is incapable of love or flesh. The church and state are fused. The Gloom Knights preside over both temple and battlefield. There are no sermons—only decrees. No prayers—only obedience.

#### The Pyre Doctrine (Military Hierarchy)

War is not a tragedy in Burach—it is a sanctity. Children are raised on tales of conquest and martyrdom. Education is reserved for the rich, but weapon drills are given to all. The military hierarchy, known formally as the The Pyre Doctrine, is sacred, precise, and terrifying:

| Rank        |                                  | Duties                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Velkharin   | The Gloom Knights.               | Divine executioners and holy warriors. Untouchable, unchallenged.                 |
| Kael’Tharan | The Knightly Orders.             | Elite bloodlines bound by oath, often granted personal sigils and strongholds.    |
| Sarnaveth   | The Inquisitors of the Cincture. | Enforcers, spell-hunters, and interrogators.                                      |
| Ravakarim   | Martial Commanders.              | Field leaders, tacticians, and siege masters.                                     |
| Mol’Sarath  | Beast Riders.                    | Nomadic cavalry from annexed provinces, trained to tame monstrosities.            |
| Dregharim   | The Conscripts.                  | The poor, the desperate, and the punished—thrown into fire with blade and prayer. |

The Burach military machine is one of calculated strategy and relentless precision. Burach’s armies move in perfect formations, each soldier drilled to fulfill their role without hesitation. Tactical decisions are entrusted to prestigious commanders, whose strategies are studied as scripture within the officer academies. Duty, efficiency, and order are the core tenets of Burach warfare. Every siege is orchestrated with surgical intent. Every battle unfolds like a grim ballet. To the Burach Empire, war is not simply a necessity—it is an expression of divine order.

Some Valekari are kept as imperial weapons, hidden and controlled. Their service is secret. Their faces masked. If exposed, they are unmade. Soldiers pray to Immariel for perfection and clarity, while a rare few whisper Thaelon’s name—the Arch-Angel of Vigilance—hoping he watches their sacrifice. But only the Velkharin are said to be heard.

In peace, there is conquest. In conquest, there is purification. The Empire does not negotiate. They assimilate or they annihilate. Resistance is not crushed—it is burned. Entire cities vanish beneath the roar of fire and the hymns of the faithful.

### The Land

The Burach Empire was built atop a foundation of natural power. Its geography is dominated by vast forests and two major mountain ranges that form a protective barrier around its heartlands. This terrain acts as a natural bulwark, shielding the Empire from invasion and allowing for strategic control over key passes and trade routes. The land is divided into four principal regions: Abenland, Nordenland, Rauland, and Unterland.

  

Abenland and Unterland have always belonged to the Empire, forming its cultural and administrative core. In contrast, Nordenland and Rauland were conquered from elven territories prior to the Darkfall—seized through brutal military campaigns and political manipulation. Despite attempts at diplomatic unity, including arranged marriages and regional alliances, cultural rifts between elves and humans proved too deep. These tensions led to repeated uprisings and fragile ceasefires, now buried under centuries of enforced rule.

  

#### Physical and Historical Features

Within the Burach Empire lie many unique physical features, but none more significant than the Rock-Teeth Mountains. Hidden within their jagged peaks lies one of the empire’s greatest resources: Kareth’Vayn, meaning “Heart-Stone” in Valyun. This leyline-rich crystalline material is harvested from deep within the mountains—once a sacred elven site of magical resonance, now transformed into a Burach-controlled mining complex. The mine’s seizure during the conquest of the elven lands remains a source of deep resentment among elvenkind.

Kareth’Vayn is considered the richest known leyline-bound mineral in western Etharis—a crystalline conduit of raw magical energy. Though the Burach Empire publicly reviles magic, it guards this resource with ruthless vigilance. These stones are not used for arcane enlightenment, but as tools of dominion. Through control of Kareth’Vayn, the Empire asserts dominion over the leyline network of the west, weaponizing arcane currents not to empower—but to subjugate.

One of the most notable historical landmarks resides within Abenland, in the very heart of the capital, Altenheim. Here rises the towering Xal’Avenkar, meaning “Spire of Burning Pulse” in the Vaylun tongue. This immense crystalline formation pulses with deep crimson and violet energy, a visual tremor of divine resonance. Surrounded at all times by elite guards, the spire is considered a holy relic—not of arcane craft, but of divine origin. Citizens and clergy alike believe it is a conduit of Immariel’s power, radiating life, judgment, and fervor into the surrounding lands. Some whisper it was not placed, but grown—its roots deep in something buried beneath the capital.

While magic is feared in Burach, the Xal’Avenkar is the great exception. Pilgrims travel from all corners of the empire to kneel before it. The devout claim that proximity to its pulse calms their thoughts, burns away impurity, and grants visions. The Gloom Knights often conduct silent rituals at its base, heads bowed beneath its shadow, drawing strength not from spellcraft—but from sacred flame.
