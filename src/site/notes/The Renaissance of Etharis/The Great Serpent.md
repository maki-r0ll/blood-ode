### **The Origin of the Great Serpent – “The Soul That Hungered”**

Only a few hundred years ago, a soul-touched child was born beneath a blood moon, in a forgotten village not far from the edges of the Black Mire. Marked by fate and gifted by a wandering soul—one of those rare, radiant fragments that drift through the Veil between life and death—this child was said to carry a destiny too large for one body. He could sense the unseen, speak to spirits in dreams, and channel forces far beyond mortal reckoning.

He was meant for greatness. Some believed he was touched by the gods, others that he would one day become one himself.

But the child strayed.

Drawn by nightmares and whispers no one else could hear, the soul-touched wandered into the Black Mire—a land soaked in dread, decay, and ancient sorrow. The Mire is no place for mortals. Twisted beasts stalk its boggy paths. The air is thick with rot and magic. It is said that here, the leylines run wild beneath the earth, veins of power older than the gods, pulsing with magic unshaped and unclaimed.

The soul-touched felt _called_. In the heart of the Mire, he found a place where the leylines tangled like a knot. He reached into them—not out of malice, but curiosity. Hunger. Perhaps desperation to prove himself worthy of the gift he was given.

And the leylines answered.

They poured into him not with grace, but violence. Power more ancient than words tore through his body, twisting the divine gift into something other. He screamed as his form was unmade and remade. His spirit, still tethered to the soul within, grew hollow with each breath until only _hunger_ remained.

He slithered forth from that place, shedding his name, his past, his humanity. He became **The Great Serpent**, and the land shuddered in his wake.

Even now, the Mire remains within reach of the gods—but their light does not easily pierce its fog. Those who enter may hear the Serpent’s call in their dreams, feel a gnawing emptiness in their bellies. Some resist, and are devoured. Others fall to their knees and are transformed, scales growing where skin once lay, their eyes glowing with predatory purpose.
### **Covenant of the Coil**

The Covenant of the Coil is a fanatical cult devoted to the Great Serpent, a monstrous being of endless hunger that slumbers within the Black Mire. Its followers do not worship with prayer, but with blood. They hunt, sacrifice, and shed their humanity in hopes of one day joining the Serpent in its eternal hunt. The deeper their devotion, the more serpentine they become—until at last, they shed their final skin and slither beside their god, not as worshipers… but as kin.

> “When the flesh gives way, when the voice is no longer needed, they will slither beside Him in silence. Not as worshipers. Not as servants. But as kin.”
#### **1. The Hollow**

- **Initiates**, lost souls who’ve first heard the Serpent’s call.

- They begin empty—no identity, no voice, shaved heads, and given only a number until they are deemed ready.

- Forbidden to speak unless spoken to.
---
#### **2. The Taken**

- Those who have accepted the hunger and performed their first sacrifice.

- They are given names by higher ranks—names that mean nothing outside the Covenant.

- Allowed to hunt under supervision.
---
#### **3. The Bound**

- Fully inducted members who now bear their first physical mark (scales, eyes shift, voice begins to change).

- They are bound to the Serpent’s hunger and to the Covenant.

- Serve as guides, recruiters, and handlers for the Hollow.
---
#### **4. The Maw**

- Leaders of regional cells; they “speak the hunger” and interpret the dreams of the Great Serpent.

- Known for their calm, eerie demeanor and emotionless sermons.

- Often lead sacrificial rituals and wear veils or masks.
---
#### **5. The Molten**

- The highest rank beneath the Great Serpent itself.

- Believed to hear the Serpent directly and carry out its true will.

- Their presence is rare and unsettling; few outside the Maw have seen them.

- Said to no longer eat normal food—they sustain themselves only through worship.

### **Ascension Through the Covenant of the Coil**

> _“The more you feed the hunger, the more it feeds on you. To become Him, you must first be hollowed of yourself.”_

---

### **1. The Hollow**

- **Physical Traits:** No changes yet—still fully human.

- **Mental Traits:** Begin hearing whispers in dreams; a constant gnawing hunger at the edges of thought.

- **Ritual Requirement:** Must undergo the Rite of Starvation—days of fasting, darkness, and silence to “empty the self.”

---

### **2. The Taken**

- **Physical Traits:** Pupils begin to narrow; occasional scaling on fingertips or forearms.

- **Mental Traits:** Begin to experience flickering visions of the Hunt—seeing themselves in a place that doesn’t exist.

---

### **4. The Maw**

### **5. The Molten**

- **Physical Traits:** Entirely covered in scale, humanoid form barely retained; some no longer speak.

- **Mental Traits:** Bound completely to the Serpent’s hunger. No personal ambition remains—only the Hunt.

- **Transformation:** Eventually shed their last skin and become something monstrous: vast, snakelike beings that dwell in the deepest reaches of the Mire, hunting with the Great Serpent.

- **Final Rite:** The Shedding. A sacred moment witnessed only by other Molten, where the old flesh is discarded in total silence.
